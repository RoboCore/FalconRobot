* Exp8_SerialDrive - FalconRobot Experiment 8
*
* Now let's experiment with the distance sensor. This ultrasonic sensor let you
* detect a collision before it really happens. You can read the exact distance
* from the robot to the obstacle.
*
* Hardware setup:
* The motors must be connected, and the board must be receiving power from the
* battery. The motor switch must also be switched to ON.
*
* This sketch was written by RoboCore, with lots of help from the Arduino
* community(especially from Sparkfun). This code is completely free for any use.
